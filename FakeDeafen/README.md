# FakeDeafen
Listen or even talk in a voice chat while being self-deafened.

![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52377180/151658665-3d15c25f-3edf-4a52-99e9-a1afbdf52e0f.gif)

### How to use:
1. Enter voice channel
2. Mute or Deafen yourself
3. Enable Fake Mute/Deafen by clicking toggle button or selecting option in a Mute/Deafen context menu
4. Now your Mute/Deafen state is fixated for others, i.e. you can toggle Mute/Deafen and this change won't display in a voice chat but you will be able to listen or talk
5. Have fun!
